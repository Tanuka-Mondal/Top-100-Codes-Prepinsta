### Given an integer input the objective is to check whether or not the given integer is an Abundant Number. 

### Example
```
Input : Number = 12
Output : Yes, It's an Abundant Number
Explanation : The Factors for the number 12 are, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. We don't want to include the number itself.
Now the sum of the factors except the number itself is :
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16
as the number 16>12 , the number itself.
It's an abundant number.
